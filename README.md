# How it works
1. Install `sherlock` client on your device(s) and set your server domain (default is `ip.semiversus.com`)
2. Install `sherlock` server on your server (or use the default server)
2. Visit your sherlock server (or the default https://ip.semiversus.com) to get the IP address of your devic in your network

This is the client part. The server part is here: https://github.com/SpectraPhysicsRankweil/sherlock-server
